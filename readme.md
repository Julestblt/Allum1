                                            Welcome to my project

Rules : 

There is 11 matches the goal is to make your opponent take the last one.

You can only remove between 1 to 3 matches per round.

You are against a strong IA so you need to be smarter than her.


                                             How to use this project :     

Download or clone this repository.

Once you have done this launch your terminal and execute the program like this :

`php allum1.php`

Then a message will appear :

`Do you want to start ? Yes/No or enter for random :`

Enter yes to start, no to let the IA start first and press enter to do a random start

After this you can play and enjoy the game.
